# age-of-coders

 I created this repo to practice my abilities with React.
The web site will be using React and I will be accessing this
[Age of empires](https://age-of-empires-2-api.herokuapp.com/docs/#/resources) API.

 Css will also be practiced here, mainly the Grid component.

 While this project is made for me to practice, I will also enjoy doing
it. I'm a big fan of Age Of Empires!

 Please do contact me if you have any suggestions, all feedback is much appreciated.  

 ## It is important to note that to run the project we need to cd age-of-coders, then npm start
